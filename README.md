## About
Coming soon.

## Running in a development instance
Docker and Docker Compose are prerequisites for developing on this project.

To develop on this application with a cloned repository, you can run (from the
base of the repo)
```
docker-compose up -d
```

This will spin up a container listening on port 8080 with an unpopulated but
prepared SQLite database. The application will launch and bind to localhost:8080.
